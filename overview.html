        Historical Development of the Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics
      </h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics is a merger of four enterprises
        which were working independently in the sea transport sector. These were
        Ethiopian Shipping Lines Share Company, Ethiopian Maritime and Transit
        Service Enterprise, Dry Port Enterprise; and the former Comet Transport
        Share Company which was consolidated in to the new company, August,
        2016.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Among the major companies that has helped coming in to being of the new
        merger is the former Ethiopian Shipping Lines Share Company (ESL),
        established March 1, 1956 E.C with a capital of 50,000 (fifty thousand)
        Ethiopian birr. This establishment laid the corner stone for the
        development of modern sea transport in Ethiopia. When the shipping line
        was established, the American Towrus Investment had 51% and the
        Commercial Bank of Ethiopia 51% and Ministry of Finance 49% capital
        share. Later, ESLâ€™s capital was made to upgrade to 375,000 (three
        hundred seventy thousand Birr). It was at this time, the enterprise had
        three ships built namely, Queen of Sheba, Lion of Judea, and Lalibella.
        Accordingly, one can infer that the enterprise has commercialized its
        service operation in 1956 E.C with these three ships built.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The Enterprise has acquired, the ships Adulis, 1959 E.C, Tana Hayke 1960
        E.C, Ashenge 1961 and laid a sound foundation to march as best modern
        sea transport providing enterprise.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The enterprise as initiated in such a historical upheaval and advancing
        as a pioneer African shipping company could not sustain its initial
        development. Due to a war broken out between Israel and Egypt from 1959
        â€“ 1967 and the closing of Suez Canal has forced the enterprise vessels
        to voyage down through South Africa via West Africa to North. Because
        these routes were very much long and the vessels turn over voyages were
        very slow and the burden of cost of vessel fuel was very high it made
        the enterprise bankrupt.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The enterprise striving in such a way to sustain its existence faced a
        major challenge in the course of development due to a new upheaval
        observed in 1967 revolution and change of government and the new
        political economical ideology implemented in Ethiopia. The enterprise
        faith at this time was to be confiscated as a state public enterprise as
        it was to other manufacturing and public enterprises. The enterprise is
        given a name Ethiopian Shipping Line Corporation and it became a fully
        state owned company with a capital of 22 million Birr. After few years,
        the companyâ€™s capital reached 32 million Birr and it relatively made
        relieved itself from loss and it had begun to be profitable.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In order to strengthen its business capacity, it has brought second hand
        made ships namely Ras Dejen and Karamara, in 1967 E.C and 1970 E.C
        respectively and deployed them in operation. In subsequent years it has
        owned a tanker ship named Nebelbal in 1971 E.C and expanded its service
        rendering horizon.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Side by side the enterprise has discarded these worn out ships that
        terminated their service years and substituted them with other more
        capable vessels in subsequent years. Additionally it has brought Key
        Kokeb and Wol Wal ships in 1974 E.C and Meskerem and Abay Wonz in 1976
        E.C and Abyot, Andinet and Netsanet in 1977 E.C and could generate
        outstanding Profit within a short period of time and it has boosted its
        cargo handling capacity in folds.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Besides building its capacity, during the nineteen sixties it has
        expanded its trade routes from the Red Sea to North and West Europe to
        Britannia and its vicinity, for example, North Eastern Europe,
        Mediterranean and Adriatic seas as well as Middle East and its
        neighboring countries.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The enterprise has progressed in its capacity building and bought the
        vessels Omo Wenz in 1978 E.C, Ziway and Chamo in 1980 E.C, Awash in 1981
        E.C and have aggrandized its profitability, providing wider services for
        international and national import and export cargos. It has bought Admas
        in 1987 E.C, Tekeze in 1991 E.C, Shebelle in 1998 E.C and Gibe in 1999
        and has provided effective sea transport services. Thus the capital of
        the enterprise has been increasing from time to time.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The other major enterprise that shares a significant part in the merger
        was Ethiopian Maritime and Transit Services Enterprise. That enterprise
        has been established in April 1960 E.C with a capital of 500,000 Birr to
        facilitate and expedite the movement of import and export cargoes. This
        enterprise has played its national role at all ports it has been
        functioning. And after the nations import and export cargoes were being
        served at Djibouti port, equipping itself with port machinery, effective
        service provision system and well-skilled human power it has handled all
        the tasks that are related with shipping and logistics services at major
        ports. Even before the Ethio â€“ Ertirean war, the enterprise has mainly
        provided outstanding stevedoring shore handling, transit and inland
        transport services.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        On the other hand, The Dry Port Enterprise established in 1999 has
        performed great tasks in reducing the cost, time and property losses at
        Djibouti port by implement dry port initiative and expansion projects.
        Though itâ€™s a recent development, it has exhibited a tremendous port and
        ports related performance excellence.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Comet Transport Services Joined ESL, to provide inland transport service
        for import and export government as well as private sector cargoes with
        sound institutional capacity.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        At this time, in a bid to build up an efficient sea transport and
        logistics system compatible private with the fast grow and development
        of the nation, with the help of favorable government policies, the four
        enterprises mentioned above have been merged in 2004 E.C.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The initial and approved capital of the new merger was 3.7 billion Birr.
        Looking the prospective capacity of the enterprise and its role the
        Council of Ministry on its plenary meeting have upgraded the capital
        from 3.7 billion to 20 billion Birr
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-5 text-color-secondary">Establishment</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        To maintain the commendable economic growth that has been registered in
        the country over the last several years, one of the strategic measures
        taken by the Federal Government of Ethiopia is merging the former three
        public enterprises that have until recently been operating separately in
        a rather similar and interdependent maritime sub-sector; namely,
        Ethiopian Shipping Lines S.C, Maritime and Transit Services Enterprise
        and Dry Port Enterprise.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprise (ESL for short)
        is the result of this merger. This newly amalgamated enterprise came
        into being following the issuance of Regulation by the Council of
        Ministers (Regulation No. 255/2011), and is vested with the huge
        responsibility of rendering sea-transport &amp; logistics services to
        the countryâ€™s importers, exporters, and investors in a more effective
        and efficient way, by reducing transit time, cost and hand offs.
        Besides, a truck operating company named Comet Transport SC has recently
        been transferred to ESL following a government decree issued in the mid
        of 2014.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        ESL has a multitude of vessels, heavy duty trucks, sea and dry port
        facilities, chicaneries, etc that enable it render efficient sea and
        land transport services as well as sea and dry port services.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        ESL has its headquarters located in the heart of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
        with main branches at Djibouti, Modjo, and Kality (the former Comet) and
        other branches in Mekelle, DireDawa, Kombolcha, Semera and Gelan towns.
        It also has a Maritime Training Institute at a place called Babogaya in
        Bishoftu (former Debrezeit) Town.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The Enterprise is re-starting the building work of its Head Office, the
        process of which has been interrupted for some years due to construction
        related problems. The giant building in Laghar area is a 20 storey sky
        scraper that may accommodate all the enterpriseâ€™s functions at head
        office level, upon finishing, as well as partially serving as an
        apartment. For further reading please download the amharic document here
